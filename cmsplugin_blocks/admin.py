You are advised that you may not expose model object to Django admin,
since DjangoCMS make object duplication to fit along its draft/publish page
process (a plugin entry is duplicated for the different publish states).

It would be troubling and would lead to issues with users and content managing.

Remove this warning if you plan to do it anyway.
